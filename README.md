Please download a zip package and use npm i and then node server.js and npm start. And Have fun!

## Running the app

To run the application on your machine:

    Clone or download the repository.
    Open it in your IDE.
    Run cd mock-chat and npm i.
    Then run node server.js.
    Then npm start.

Please make sure you have CORS extension installed on your browser, although the headers on the server I wrote should take care of that issue. 

For full compatibilty please use Chrome.
